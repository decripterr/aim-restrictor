Advanced Combat Control System for FiveM
This script is an advanced combat control system for FiveM, designed to prevent unintended roll or jump actions while aiming, while allowing smooth and unrestricted running. It provides a better combat experience by reducing glitches and ensuring more immersive roleplay mechanics in combat situations.

Key Features
Block Jump and Roll: Disables the ability to jump or roll while the player is aiming with a weapon.

Running While Aiming: Allows the player to run (SHIFT) while aiming, ensuring movement is not interrupted.

Optimized Performance: Reduces server load by dynamically adjusting the wait time based on the player's state (idle, aiming, running, etc.).

Customizable: Easily modify the script to add more features, change control bindings, or adjust control restrictions.
